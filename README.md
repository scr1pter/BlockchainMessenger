MERN__Mongo Express React Node Blockchain Messenger

This application is the result of research for my master thesis.

It is an online messaging application between 2 users per conversation, providing a satisfactory degree of reliability and certification in terms of message content, which remains unchanged and is protected through Blockchain technology. This Blockchain technology is used through the BigchainDB tool/API and also a 'local' copy of the blockchain is stored in a traditional MongoDB / NoSQL database. Every message a user sends, is first sent to the BigchainDB blockchain as a transaction object where it is verified and safely stored in encrypted form. After that, the same message object is stored as a block in the local (manually created) blockchain of MongoDB, meaning that each message is one and only block. If and when something is deleted from the local blockchain, we are fetching it from the BigchainDB and reconstruct the blockchain from scratch. Thus, a hybrid certified messaging model is created in which the local computer acts as a node of the BigchainDB blockchain network and the two databases work together to obtain the result of the immutable, decentralized and distributed messaging application.
